This is the frontend of a Software-as-a service, I recently spearheaded as the lead developer. This repo has its basic foundational code. As its a commercial app. Its code is not public, though you can access the finished project at https://app.shopmgr.co

The app was built using Nuxtjs 3 framework and it was created as a statically generated site to leverage speed of SSG sites in rendering the site as a Progressive Webapp.
